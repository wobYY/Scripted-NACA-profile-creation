# WIP

This project is still **Work In Progress**.

# Goal of the project

The goal of this project is to automate a lot of manual labour that's done in order to do a CFD simulation of an airfoil. This script creates the airfoil using the provided coordinates, creates the 3D model of it, creates a mesh for a CFD simulation using Altair's software.

## Planned features

[x] Load a file and create a 2D extrudable sketch in FreeCAD (enables it to be ran on HPC) - 40%
[ ] Export the file in the necessary format (STEP) - 5%
[ ] Create the mesh from the 3D model - 40%
[ ] Run a CFD simulation using the 3D model on HPC - 10%
[ ] Postprocessing of the results (CD/CL)
